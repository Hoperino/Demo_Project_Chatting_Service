### What is this repository for? ###

It is for showcase of code that I wrote. The code contains two classes - one server and one client. The server
maintains multiple clients connected to localhost on port 8000. The clients can then procced to chat using the server. The project is quite small, but is done as form of exercise so if you have some remarks, critics or advices, don't hesitate to hit me up! 

You can write to me at : mihailmilkov94@gmail.com

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Start the server.
2. Start client one.
3. Start another client. 
4. Write name and message in the client view.

### Where can i find the classes? ###

The classes are in folder "src/MultiChat"
