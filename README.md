### What is this repository for? ###

It is for showcase of code that I wrote. The code contains two classes- one server and one client. The server
maintains multiple clients connected to localhost on port 8000. The clients can then procced to chat using the server.

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Start the server.
2. Start client one.
3. Start another client. 
4. Write name and message in the client view.

### Where can i find the classes? ###

The classes are in folder "src/MultiChat"
