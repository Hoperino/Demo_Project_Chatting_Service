/**
 * Created by Mihail Milkov on 22/08/2017.
 * This project is the answer to :
 *
 *          31.10 (Multiple client chat) Write a program that enables any number of clients to
 *          chat. Implement one server that serves all the clients, as shown in FigureÂ 31.22.
 *          Name the client Exercise31_10Client and the server Exercise31_10Server.
 *          (In our case simply "Server" and "Client")
 *
 * From "Introduction to Java Programming, Comprehensive Edition 10" - Y.Daniel Liang
 *
 * The aim of this server is to facilitate multiple clients that can chat among them.
 * The clients run client-side software that serves as a view/controller
 * The server is build by providing a new Thread to each incoming client.
 * Whenever input is provided from one client, it is distributed
 * to the output stream of the others. This means that the client-side should implement format check before sending.
 * The server is simply built, therefore restraints and complexity are left for the client.
 *
 * NOTES: To keep track of clients, ArrayList is used. The method that accesses the list is synchronized. In addition,
 * I have included small MySQL server that can be used to store all of the chatting data. To handle connection and
 * interface with the DB server, I have created MySQLDBHandler.java that is used in the ClientHandler class to first record
 * all of the received data and then disseminate it to other clients.
 *
 * The server listens on port 8000
 *
 * For further questions please write to mihailmilkov94@gmail.com
 *
 * This Application is meant to be taken as an example and a small demonstration of how a simple, back-end server
 * can be used for chatting service.
